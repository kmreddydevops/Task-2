        <p>
          Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work
          continued on other phases of the project for another five years. The
          first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan,
          on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz
          Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
          entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹5
          million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8
          million).

          The mausoleum building is the central structure of the entire complex.
          It is a white marble structure standing on a 6-metre (20 ft) high
          square plinth with sides measuring 95.5 metres (313 ft) in length. The
          base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners
          forming an eight-sided structure that is approximately 57.3 metres
          (188 ft) long on each of the four long sides.
